<p>When filmmakers make films, they pick the people who best embody each role. David Fincher doesn’t always use Brad Pitt, even though he was fantastic in Fight Club and Se7en. Christopher Nolan doesn’t always use the same lead actor either. Leonardo DiCaprio was awesome in Inception, as was Guy Pearce in Memento, as was Christian Bale in the Batman movies, but you’d never interchange them—they were too perfectly cast.</p>

<p>Similarly, I believe in order to build something great you have to pick the best people for the role. Sometimes you have the right people internally and other times you to have to add someone from the outside. In any way, in order to be successful you want to have the best team capable for the job.  I’m one of those people that can bring something new to the table. I’m a self-thought Product Designer with a decade of experience designing software for companies and startups. I enjoy working at the intersection between business strategy and design. I use a combination of data, user-research and logic to come to solutions that will thrive the business forward while delivering a pleasant experience for the user. </p>

<p>I made my way into the field by building my own side-projects. Some of my products — web, iOS and Mac OS X apps — made it to the #1 top paid App Store position and have been covered by NY Times, The Verge, The Next Web, TechCrunch, Lifehacker, Fast Co Labs and many more.</p>
